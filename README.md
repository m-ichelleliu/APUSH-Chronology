# APUSH-Chronology

Fully automated text-based study program tailored to learning the "chronology" portion of AP US History curriculum at my high school, which entails memorizing the order of selected events in the textbook. Used by classmates to study for exams! Fun high school side project that I was pretty proud of back then.

Features:

- Automated parsing of the chronology section of every single chapter in the textbook with a direct copy-paste from the textbook website
- Select one chapter at a time, or multiple chapters at once, and all events from selected chapters will be quizzed on
- Option to study the year of each event (eg.1932, 1933) or to enable "jenny" mode, in which the number of each event according to their relative order is used (eg. 1,2,3...44)
- Three study modes: 
    - Multiple Choice: Pick the correct year or number out of three options for a given event
    - Free Response: Type the correct year or number out of three options for a given event
    - Order Events: Same format as the weekly quizzes! Given five events, respond with their correct relative order
- View statistics for your overall correctness on each event to figure out which ones are giving you the most trouble
